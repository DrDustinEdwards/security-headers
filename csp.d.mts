/**
 * Content-Security-Policy helpers: a per-request nonce, a hash source for an inline script, and the policy a site's
 * own list of what it loads builds.
 *
 * - generateNonce is foxhound's (app/lib/http/security-headers.ts): 16 random bytes, base64. Call it
 *   once per request and give the same value to the rendered <script nonce> and to the policy.
 * - scriptHash is dustinedwards.info's (workers/csp.mjs): Web Crypto rather than node:crypto, so a
 *   Worker and a Node gate run one function.
 * - buildContentSecurityPolicy takes the hosts a site loads, per kind, plus its nonce or hashes, and returns the
 *   header (enforced, or Report-Only so a repo can ship the policy before it blocks anything). It is the one place
 *   the policy's fixed parts (object-src, base-uri, frame-ancestors, form-action, the report sink) and the
 *   Cloudflare Web Analytics beacon are written.
 * - buildPolicy is the plain join, for a policy that is not a page's (a sandboxed media route).
 *
 * Which to use, nonce or hash: a response that is never shared-cached may carry a nonce. A response that is
 * edge-cached must not, since every reader would share one nonce for the cache lifetime; trust its inline scripts
 * by hash instead.
